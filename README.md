# QNEAT3

The QNEAT3 (short for Qgis Network Analysis Toolbox 3) Plugin aims to provide sophisticated QGIS Processing-Toolbox algorithms in the Field of Network Analysis. In order to assure usability and consitency in the QGIS software design, the QNEAT3-Plugin is not designed as a simple GUI extension but as an QGIS Processing provider for Processing toolbox algorithms. Further information will be provided at the corresponding [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Design-of-advanced-network-analysis-algorithms-for-the-QGIS-processing-library) project-website.

### Currently implemented algorithms:
- **Shortest Path** (Dijkstra) between two points (pairs of coordinates obtained by using QGIS-GUI)
- **Origin-Destination Matrices** Matrix between all points of a layer.
- **ISO-Area Algorithms** Algorithms for isochrone area calculation (pointcloud, raster, polygon)

### Currently planned algorithms
- **Shortest Path**(Dijkstra) between two points in layers
- **Isochrone Raster and Polygon** calculation with advanced interpolation techniques

All routing algorithms are ready to calculate direction-dependent routing.

**Please note that the current code in this repository is not yet properly working and containes prototypes that were tested intensively.** 

**Due to the fact that I work full time, updates to the repository may be not that frequently.**
